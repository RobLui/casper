## Details

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install casper2

This will install the Gateway theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/casper2`.

### Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `casper2`.

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/casper2
    
If you want to set Casper2 as the default theme, you can do so by following these steps:

* Navigate to `/your/site/grav/user/config`.
* Open the **system.yaml** file.
* Change the `theme:` setting to `theme: casper2`.
* Save your changes.

### GPM Update (Preferred)

    bin/gpm update casper2

This command will check your Grav install to see if your Gateway theme is due for an update. If a newer release is found, you will be asked whether or not you wish to update. To continue, type `y` and hit enter. The theme will automatically update and clear Grav's cache.

## Thank You

Grav has fantastic team, people that are very helpful and people that I probably bored to death, 
or at least quite a lot to achieve what I want. 
In [Slack's chat room](https://getgrav.slack.com/messages) I bugged always helpful `@andrewscofield`
`@ricardo`, and `@olevik`.

Words cannot express how thankful I am to all of you. I'm the one to blame if anything is wrong, ðŸ˜…
but you guys helped to get most of the things right. So kudos to you. 

And at last, but not least - Thank You if you're using this theme. ðŸ™‚
